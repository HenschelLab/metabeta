This directory ontains scripts for populating data to SQL. 
"PopulateSQLfromBiom.py" works for parsing any biom tables (we used for Qiime DB and SRA) to populate SQL tables with samples,otus,envos, and sample metadta, including study.
"populateChaffronDataset.py and populateChaffronDataset2.py" are specifically written for parsing the Chaffron data sets and their metadata.

In the Data directory, are to key files
"chafronOtus_to_greengenes13_5.txt" was made by 100% similarity check for chaffron otus against the green green genes 13_5. The key can be used for replacing the otus in the SQL database.
"greengenes11_TO_greengenes13_5.txt" was made by 100% similarity check for green genes 11 against the green green genes 13_5. The key can be used for replacing the otus in the SQL database.

***All the scripts are available under GNU V3 lisence***
