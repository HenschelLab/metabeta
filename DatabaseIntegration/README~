This directory ontains scripts for populating data to SQL. 
"PopulateSQLfromBiom.py" works for parsing any biom tables (we used for Qiime DB and SRA) to populate SQL tables with samples,otus,envos, and sample metadta, including study.
"populateChaffronDataset.py and populateChaffronDataset2.py" are specifically written for parsing the Chaffron data sets and their metadata.


***All the scripts are available under GNU V3 lisence***
